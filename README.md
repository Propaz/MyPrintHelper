# MyPrintHelper
A simple program For working with monochrome or color printers. 

For work in the service center.

1. Button "Find Printers" Displays a list of devices in the system (Only devices online, except for FAX and XPS devices.)
(Some priors of HP even after the shutdown remain in the system with the flags Local = True, WorkOffline = true, so they fall into the list (yet).)

2. The 'Print the B/W Grid' button allows you to print an A4 page that is completely filled with a grid.

3. The 'Print the Rainbow' button allows you to print a Rainbow gradient on Page.
