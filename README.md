# MyPrintHelper
A simple program For working with laser monochrome printers. 

For work in the service center.

1. Button "Find Printers" Displays a list of devices in the system (Only devices online, except for FAX and XPS devices.)
(Some priors of HP even after the shutdown remain in the system with the flags Local = True, WorkOffline = true, so they fall into the list (yet).)

2. The 'Print the Grid' button allows you to print an A4 page that is completely filled with a grid.

3. The 'Get Properties' button allows you to get a list of printer properties (Strings without titles do not fall into the list).
