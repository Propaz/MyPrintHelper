# MyPrintHelper
A simple program for working with monochrome or color printers. 

For work in the service center.

1. Button "Find Printers" Displays a list of devices in the system (Only devices online, except for FAX and XPS devices.)
(Some printers HP even after the shutdown remain in the system with the flags Local = True, WorkOffline = true, so they fall into the list (yet).)

2. The 'Print the B/W Grid' button allows you to print an A4 page that is completely filled with a grid.

3. The 'Print the Rainbow' button allows you to print a Rainbow (600x600) gradient on Page.

4. You can send rectangle 720x1000 (almost full a4 page) (choose CMYK or RGB test)

5. If your printer (ex. Kyocera) support Prescribe (FRPO) command, you can send command via FRPO gui (custom command, script file or choose from integrated command). (Theoretically it will works with PJL scripts, not tested yet...)
